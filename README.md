## üñ•Ô∏è Codebase

##### [Embedded](https://github.com/roboticsatiowa/Rover_Embedded)
This repository contains the code that runs on the Teensy 4.1 microcontroller. It interfaces with the motor controllers and sensors on the rover. It is written in C/C++ and can be programmed with the PlatformIO extension for Visual Studio Code. Functionally, it acts as a bridge between the Raspberry Pi and the hardware by providing expanded I/O
<br>

##### [Base Station](https://github.com/roboticsatiowa/Base-Station)
This repository contains code that will run locally on the base station (at the time of writing my laptop). It uses a robotics framework called ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2). It consists of several simple nodes that handle various tasks such as parsing controller input, displaying sensor data, and sending commands to the rover. Most of the code is written in Python.
<br>

##### [Rover](https://github.com/roboticsatiowa/Rover)
The bulk of our code resides in this repository. It is a docker application which allows it to run on almost any hardware with docker suport. It is written in Python and uses the ROS2 framework. The code is responsible for everything involving control of the rover in addition to communication with the base station. It controls the rover by interfacing with the Teensy 4.1 over USB serial with a custom protocol.

    <summary>Description</summary>
    Receives input from a microcontroller and high voltage from a power supply to drive a stepper motor. It takes 6 data pins: PUL+, PUL-, DIR+, DIR-, ENA+, and ENA-. Of these 6 data pins, 3 of them are grounds (PUL-, DIR- and ENA-). The ground pins can be ignored because their only purpose is to complete the electrical circuit so current can flow. ENA+ is left unconnected and can be ignored. This leaves 2 pins of importance: PUL+ and DIR+. DIR+ controls the direction of the stepper motor. When it is held high (3.3 volts or 5 volts) the motor will spin in one direction, then when its low (0 volts) it will spin in the opposite direction. PUL+ is a square wave that controls the speed of the motor. When there is no signal (0 volts) the motor will be stationary. When there is a square wave the motor will increment a small step each time the pin is pulsed. Rapid pulses will result in a high motor speed, while slow pulses will result in a slow motor speed.

    <b>BATTERIES ARE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. FIND AN EXPERIENCED MEMBER TO HELP</b><br>
    This is a 6000 mah 6S LiPo battery. This means that it contains 6 lithium polymer (LiPo) cells in series and has a total capacity of 6000 milliamp-hours (1 amp-hour per cell). a LiPo battery has a minimum and maximum voltage of 3.2 and 4.2 volts respectivly. This means there is a total range of 19.2 to 25.2 volts. If the battery is overcharged or over discharged outside this range it will degrade in performance rapidly and immediately. Use extreme caution not to overcharge or overdischarge the batteries.
